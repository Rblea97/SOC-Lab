# Triage Methodology

This document captures the triage logic I applied to each of the five detection scenarios in this lab — what the alert means operationally, what I check next, what separates a true positive from a benign event, what action I take, and when I escalate.

---

## Rule 5763 — SSH Brute Force (Scenario 02)

**What it means operationally:** 8+ failed SSH authentication attempts from the same source IP within the rule's frequency window. Level 10 — high severity. Automated credential stuffing is the most likely cause.

**What I check next:**
- `firedtimes` — how many times did the rule fire? 36 firings over 45 seconds confirms sustained automated activity, not a fat-finger login.
- Process IDs in the correlated events — multiple distinct PIDs (4167, 4175, 4183, 4190) firing simultaneously confirms parallel threads, consistent with Hydra `-t 4`.
- **Rule 100002** — did it fire? If yes, a credential was obtained and there is an active compromise. If no (as in this scenario), the brute force failed.

**Malicious vs. benign:** 8+ failures per frequency window, sub-second inter-event gaps across 4 simultaneous source PIDs, and a generic target username (`kali`) — all consistent with automated tooling, not an interactive login session.

**Containment action:** Block source IP (`ufw deny from 192.168.10.11`), enforce key-based auth (`PasswordAuthentication no` in `sshd_config`), deploy fail2ban. Full steps in [IR-2026-002](ir-report-ssh-brute-force.md) §6.

**Escalate when:** Rule 100002 fires — a successful login following failures means the brute force succeeded and post-exploitation activity must be assumed.

## Rule 100011 — Network Scan (Scenario 01)

**What it means operationally:** 12+ SSH connection attempts to invalid users from the same source IP within 60 seconds, via MS-2's syslog feed. This is reconnaissance — the attacker is probing for valid usernames before an authentication attack.

**What I check next:**
- Source IP — internal (192.168.10.11) suggests a compromised or authorized test machine.
- Timing relative to other alerts — a scan alert followed within minutes by rule 5763 or 100002 indicates a coordinated attack sequence, not an isolated event.
- The `previous_output` field in the alert — shows the correlated events; confirm whether the username pattern is generic (`scanuser`) or targeted (`root`, `admin`).

**Malicious vs. benign:** Legitimate SSH clients don't hit 12 invalid users in 60 seconds. No benign explanation exists for this pattern — it is scanner-generated by definition.

**Containment action:** Block source IP if the scan is unsolicited. Log the targeted usernames — they reveal the attacker's reconnaissance data and inform password hygiene priorities.

**Escalate when:** Scan is immediately followed by brute force attempts (rules 5763 or 100002) — the attacker moved from discovery to credential access, indicating an active intrusion attempt.

## Rule 2501 — vsftpd Authentication Failure (Scenario 03)

**What it means operationally:** `pam_unix` authentication failure on MS-2. On its own this is level 5 — low severity. Context matters: vsftpd 2.3.4 contains a backdoor triggered by a specific username pattern. A login failure following a Metasploit session open is a post-exploitation artifact, not a pre-access probe.

**What I check next:**
- Preceding alerts — was there a successful FTP connection to MS-2 shortly before? A 2501 alert that immediately follows unusual network activity to port 21 is a different event than a standalone auth failure.
- Wazuh `location` field — this alert came from `192.168.10.13` (MS-2 via syslog), not the Kali agent, meaning it is outside agent-based FIM coverage; post-exploit file artifacts on MS-2 cannot be checked automatically.
- Manual inspection of MS-2 `/etc/passwd` and running processes if a shell is suspected.

**Malicious vs. benign:** A single pam_unix failure on MS-2 is unremarkable. The same alert preceded by a port-21 connection from 192.168.10.11 using a `:)` username suffix is the vsftpd backdoor trigger — the failure is incidental to the exploit, not the attack itself.

**Containment action:** Isolate MS-2 from the network segment. Check for listening ports and active sessions before attributing the alert as a failed attempt.

**Escalate when:** Any evidence of a bind shell or reverse shell connection from MS-2 following the FTP auth event — that confirms full root compromise of the target.

---

## Rule 5402 — Sudo to Root (Scenario 04)

**What it means operationally:** A user invoked `sudo` and successfully escalated to root. Level 3 by default — low severity, because legitimate admin activity looks identical to abuse. Context is everything.

**What I check next:**
- The `data.command` field — what command was run as root? `/usr/bin/systemctl start ssh` (as captured in evidence) is plausible admin work. `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import pty...'` is a privilege escalation shell.
- Preceding authentication events — was this sudo invocation preceded by an SSH login from 192.168.10.11? If so, it may be a post-brute-force escalation.
- Whether the sudo user is expected to have sudo rights on this host.

**Malicious vs. benign:** `sudo systemctl start ssh` (the command in scenario 04's evidence) is plausible admin work in isolation. The same sudo event following a brute force alert from the same source IP, or where the command opens an interactive shell, requires investigation.

**Containment action:** None immediate for a standalone sudo event. If correlated with prior brute force success (rule 100002), assume the account is compromised — lock it, rotate credentials, review `authorized_keys`.

**Escalate when:** The sudo command opens a shell, modifies `/etc/sudoers`, or creates new accounts — any of these indicate persistence being established, not routine administration.

## Rule 100003 — Suspicious File in /tmp (Scenario 05)

**What it means operationally:** FIM (file integrity monitoring) detected a new file in `/tmp` matching `.php`, `.py`, `.sh`, `reverse`, `shell`, or `payload` in the filename. Level 10. This rule fires on post-exploitation artifact creation — a file named `reverse_shell.php` is not accidentally created.

**What I check next:**
- `syscheck.sha256_after` — hash the file and check against known webshell signatures or VirusTotal.
- File permissions and owner (`uid_after`, `gid_after`) — was it written by the `kali` user or by `www-data` / `root`? The latter indicates a compromised service wrote it.
- `syscheck.mtime_after` — does the creation time correlate with any other alerts (login events, network scan, sudo activity)?

**Malicious vs. benign:** A `.php` file named `reverse_shell.php` in `/tmp` has no benign explanation. The FIM alert confirms the file exists at the exact path with the captured SHA-256 — the evidence is the file itself.

**Containment action:** Remove the file, audit all files modified in `/tmp` and `/var/www` in the surrounding time window, check for cron jobs or systemd units referencing the path.

**Escalate when:** The file's owner is a service account (web server, database), its creation time correlates with an inbound network connection, or additional `.php`/`.sh` files are found — this indicates a webshell was uploaded, not just dropped locally.

## Rule 100002 — Why Its Silence Is Meaningful

Rule 100002 (level 12) fires when a successful SSH authentication follows 8+ failures from the same source IP within 120 seconds — brute force success. In the SSH brute force scenario, **this rule correctly did not fire**: Hydra obtained no valid credentials.

Recognizing when a rule's silence is informative is as operationally significant as recognizing when it fires. The absence of 100002 is the primary evidence that no compromise occurred — not a detection gap, but the rule behaving as designed.
